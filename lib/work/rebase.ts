/**
 * Replaying a branch onto a new base.
 *
 * The interesting outcome is not success, it is the halt. A rebase that stops
 * on a conflict leaves the tree in a state that is neither where it was nor
 * where it was going, and a tool that reports "failed" and says no more has
 * handed back a repository the caller now has to diagnose from scratch. So a
 * halt is a first-class answer that names the commit it stopped on, the paths
 * that disagree, and the two ways out.
 *
 * Nothing here decides for you. Continuing needs the conflicts resolved, which
 * is work only a person or an agent reading the code can do, and abandoning
 * throws away whatever replaying had achieved so far. Both are refusals to
 * guess rather than missing features.
