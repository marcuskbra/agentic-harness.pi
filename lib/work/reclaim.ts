/**
 * Taking back a tree nothing owns any more.
 *
 * This is the one cleanup verb here that acts rather than reporting,
 * and the asymmetry with {@link tidyPlan} is deliberate. Deleting a
 * branch destroys the only name a commit had, so tidy refuses to do
 * it. Removing a worktree destroys a directory and git's bookkeeping
 * for it, and leaves the branch exactly where it was: the commits stay
 * reachable, and re-cutting the tree at the same branch puts a person
 * back where they were. A report whose only follow-through is the
 * `git worktree` call the guide says never to make is not a path, so
 * this supplies the path.
 *
 * What may be taken back is {@link orphanedTrees}'s decision, and this
 * removes nothing it did not offer. The dirty tree and the tree whose
 * work trunk cannot vouch for stay where they are.
