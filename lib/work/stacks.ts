/**
 * Keeping a stack, and replaying it when what it sits on moves.
 *
 * The thinking lives in `stack.ts` and never touches a repository. This is the
 * adapter: it stores parentage, asks git to replay, and stops the moment a
 * replay halts.
 *
 * Parentage is stored in git's own config, under the branch it describes. That
 * puts it in the repository rather than in this package's state, which is the
 * property that matters: the record survives a session, is visible to anybody
 * who runs `git config`, and is deleted by git itself when the branch is. A
 * stack recorded in a tool's private state is a stack that quietly outlives the
 * branches it names.
 *
 * A stacked backend that tracks parentage itself is the reason this is a facet
 * rather than the implementation. On a repository driven by such a tool, its
 * record is the truth and this one would be a second opinion; a provider there
 * should offer its own `WorkStacks` instead of teaching this one a second
 * vocabulary.
 *
 * Restacking stops at the first halt and says what it did not reach. Carrying
 * on would replay later branches onto a parent that is mid-rebase, which
 * produces a stack that looks restacked and is built on a commit that is about
 * to be rewritten.
