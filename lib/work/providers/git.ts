/**
 * Cutting trees with plain git.
 *
 * The general case, so that the broker works before anything
 * downstream registers. A repo with a checkout on disk gets a git
 * worktree beside the state directory, detached at a commit for a
 * snapshot or on its branch for a worktree.
 *
 * It deliberately does not clone. A repo known only by a remote is
 * refused with the remote named, because a clone of an unasked-for
 * repo can be enormous and quietly spending ten minutes on one is a
 * surprising thing for a tool to do on its own. Saying what is
 * needed leaves the choice with whoever knows how big it is; a
 * downstream provider that knows a particular repo can serve it
 * without asking.
