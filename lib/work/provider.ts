/**
 * Choosing which provider cuts a tree.
 *
 * This replaces two brokers that sorted their providers in
 * opposite directions. One took the smallest priority number,
 * documented as "built-ins live at 100; downstream
 * specialisations use smaller numbers to take over". The other
 * took the largest, documented as "higher-priority providers are
 * consulted first". Both downstream World providers were correct
 * under their own broker while holding the same constant name at
 * 50 and at 100.
 *
 * Unifying them on either direction would silently invert one, and
 * silently is the operative word: losing does not raise anything,
 * because the general provider still produces a tree. It would
 * just be a plain git worktree where a `dev tree` was wanted,
 * which works well enough to go unnoticed.
 *
 * So the number is not a priority. A provider says how *specific*
 * it is, and more specific wins. "Priority" genuinely reads both
 * ways in English, since priority 1 can mean first or last;
 * "specificity" does not, because a provider for one repo is
 * plainly more specific than one for any repo.
