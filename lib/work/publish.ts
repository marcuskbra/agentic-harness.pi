/**
 * Publishing a branch, which is the step between committing and proposing.
 *
 * It was missing, and its absence was the one place this surface made you
 * leave it: `work record` committed, `review_offer propose` needed the branch
 * on the remote, and nothing in between was a tool. Every other seam here is
 * something you can call.
 *
 * Two rules are built in rather than offered. A first push sets upstream,
 * because a branch that pushes without one has to be told its own name every
 * time afterwards and eventually gets told the wrong one. And a force is
 * always a lease: `--force` overwrites whatever arrived while you were
 * rebasing, which on a shared branch is somebody else's work, and the honest
 * version of "I know what is there" is to say what you think is there and be
 * refused when you are wrong.
