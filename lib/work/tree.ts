 * worktree provider resolved a source repo as
 * `~/src/github.com/{owner}/{repo}`, which is correct on GitHub
 * and silently wrong everywhere else: a change on another system
 * resolves to a directory that does not exist, and the failure
 * surfaces as a missing checkout rather than as the assumption it
 * really is. A forge name baked into a path is the hardest kind of
 * assumption to notice, because every test against that forge
 * passes.
 *
 * So the question is answered from what the substrate already
 * knows. A provider that resolved a change has already said where
 * its repo is, locally or by remote, and a repo it could say
 * neither about is reported as unplaceable rather than guessed at.
