/**
 * Remembering the trees a session cut, so the next session can find them.
 *
 * The broker held its trees in an array, which is correct for exactly as long as
 * the process lives. A worktree outlives the process by design, so the next
 * session opened with the trees still on disk, git still tracking them, and
 * every verb answering "no held tree": not merely a listing that forgot, but
 * commits stranded in a directory the tool could no longer reach, releasable
 * only through the `git worktree` call the guide tells you never to make.
 *
 * No test could see it. A test builds a broker and uses it, which is one
 * process; the fault needs two.
 *
 * The directory stays the source of truth for whether a tree exists, and this
 * only supplies the identity a directory name cannot faithfully carry. When the
 * two disagree the directory wins, because somebody who deletes a tree by hand
 * has said something and a stale record has not.
 *
 * A record also says who cut it, which is a later addition and the reason
 * anything is ever reclaimed. Without it "remembered" and "held" were one set,
 * so every tree ever cut answered "something still holds it" forever: measured
 * at 59 records and 649MB on one machine, growing by a snapshot per review
 * round.
