 * whether a process was the one a lease was written about. They read
 * the same file and drew opposite conclusions from it, which is how a
 * supervisor could be filed as healthy by one reader and dead by the
 * next.
 *
 * The hard part is that a pid identifies nothing. Nothing deletes a

 * whether the process wearing it today started when the lease says
 * ours did is the only question with a true answer.
