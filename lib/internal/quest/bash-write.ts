/**
 * Extract the destination paths a bash command writes to, so the
 * gate can see where the write lands and allow scratch
 * destinations. The command is reduced to the same data-stripped
 * skeleton the classifier matches on, so a redirect that lived
 * inside quoted data raises no phantom target. Three write shapes
 * are read: redirect destinations (`>`, `>>`, excluding fd
 * redirects such as `2>`), `tee` destinations, and the file
 * argument of an in-place editor (sed -i, gsed -i, perl -i), whose
 * quoted script has already been stripped, leaving the file as a
 * trailing non-flag token.
 *
 * A target the command builds out of its own variables is expanded
 * from the assignments in that same command, since `Q=...; echo >
 * "$Q/f"` is one of the commonest ways to write to a directory whose
 * path is long. A target still carrying a sigil after that is dropped
 * rather than reported: the caller resolves what it is given against a
 * working directory, so a literal `$UNKNOWN/f.txt` becomes a real path
 * nobody wrote to, and judging the wrong file is worse than declining
 * to judge this one.
 *
 * A quoted destination counts, which is the ordinary spelling and the
 * spelling a variable almost always arrives in. Reading it does not cost
 * the protection against a `>` inside a string, because the two are
 * different questions: what makes a redirect real is its operator being
 * unquoted, not its target being bare. The command model already draws
 * that line, so the targets come from there and the patterns below stay
 * as a second pass for the grammar it declines, such as a subshell or a
 * loop. Both readings are kept because this gate wants recall: a missed
 * target is an unjudged write, while a spurious one is inert unless it
 * happens to name tracked code.
