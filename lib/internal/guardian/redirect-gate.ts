/**
 * Guardian-side glue for sending a shell command to the tool that can
 * reach the repo it names.
 *
 * `gh pr create` is the wrong instrument wherever something other than
 * GitHub hosts the changes: it reaches a mirror that has never heard of
 * them, and answers with "Could not resolve to a PullRequest with the
 * number of ...", which reads as a wrong number rather than as the wrong
 * system. A skill description helps somebody who wonders whether another
 * tool exists; this is for the case where nobody wondered.
 *
 * Only for creating. A create uses the branch in this checkout, so the
 * checkout's provider is the right question to ask. An edit names a
 * change that may live in another repo entirely, `-R` and all, so the
 * skills cover that in words rather than this guessing at it.
 *
 * Blocks once and relents on a repeat, the same machinery the title,
 * section and prose gates use, so it cannot loop and somebody who means
 * `gh` still gets it on the second try.
