/**
 * Deriving a stack from GitHub, which records none.
 *
 * GitHub knows only each pull request's base and head branch
 * names, so a stack has to be inferred by matching one
 * request's base against another's head. That inference is
 * wrong at the edges by construction: a merged parent
 * disappears from the open listing and the chain simply ends,
 * a renamed branch breaks the link, and two forks can use the
 * same branch name. This is why every stack reports its
 * provenance, and why this one always reports `derived`.
 *
 * The walk follows fan-out downwards, because a branch with two
 * children is a real shape people build and reporting only one
 * of them would be a lie of omission.
