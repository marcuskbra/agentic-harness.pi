/**
 * Reading and writing the conversation on a GitHub change.
 *
 * Three of GitHub's habits are absorbed here rather than
 * leaked. It calls the two sides of a diff LEFT and RIGHT,
 * which is a display convention, so the neutral old and new
 * are translated at this boundary. It keeps review threads in
 * GraphQL and reactions in REST, with different id systems, so
 * message ids are minted with a prefix saying which route they
 * belong to. And it pages review threads a hundred at a time,
 * so the reader keeps asking until GitHub says there is no
 * more; stopping at the first page silently loses the tail of
 * a long review.
