/**
 * Making and changing pull requests on GitHub.
 *
 * Every write goes through the REST API with a JSON body on disk,
 * rather than through `gh pr create` and its siblings. The porcelain
 * commands are friendlier to type and worse to call: they infer the
 * base from the current checkout, they read a title out of the last
 * commit when one is not given, and their flags have defaults that
 * change what an omitted argument means. A caller here has already
 * decided all of that, and inference at this layer would quietly
 * overrule it.
 *
 * The body goes through a file for the same reason a commit message
 * does. A pull request body is prose with newlines, quotes and
 * backticks in it, and putting that on a command line is a quoting bug
 * waiting for the first person who writes a shell snippet in a
 * description.
