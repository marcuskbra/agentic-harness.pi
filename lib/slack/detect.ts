/**
 * Slack content detection: finds markdown the Slack converter
 * cannot render as the author intended, so a gate can block and
 * point the author at the slack-guide skill. Each flagged
 * construct requires guessing the author's intent to translate
 * (which cells are headers, which lines are list items, where to
 * upload an image), so the gate refuses rather than guess. The
 * silent dialect translations in blocks.ts stay silent; this is
 * only for the cases that genuinely need the author's hand.
 *
 * Detection is deliberately conservative. A malformed list is
 * flagged only as a run of two or more lines, and a pipe table
 * only on a separator row or two adjacent pipe rows, so a lone
 * dash-led sentence or an inline `a | b` is never mistaken for
 * structure. A missed case is a missed block; a false block on
 * the high-volume Slack surface is far more corrosive.
