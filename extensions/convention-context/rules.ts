/**
 * The resident binding-rules block. A compact reminder of the
 * conventions the gates enforce, injected into the system prompt
 * every turn so the AI gets them right the first time and the
 * gate has less to block. The block is resident and
 * compaction-immune by virtue of riding the resident prompt
 * coordinator, so it survives the context eviction that drops a
 * skill body mid-session.
 *
 * The PR and issue section lists are built from the same
 * constants the section gate enforces, so the reminder and the
 * gate cannot drift. The prose, commit and Slack lines are kept
 * terse on purpose: this rides every prompt, so it must not
 * balloon the default context. The named skills carry the full
 * rules; this only points at them.
 *
 * One line here is not about what to write but about which tool
 * to reach for. It earns its place because a skill description
 * only helps somebody who goes looking for a skill, and the
 * failure it prevents is reaching for `gh pr create` without
 * ever wondering whether something else was meant. That happened
 * repeatedly in one session, in a repo where `gh` cannot see the
 * changes it was being asked to make.
