/**
 * Convention Context Extension
 *
 * Injects a compact, resident reminder of the authoring
 * conventions into the system prompt at the start of every turn,
 * so the AI gets a PR, issue, commit, review comment or Slack
 * message right the first time and the gates have less to block.
 *
 * The reminder rides the resident prompt coordinator (a
 * contributor at the top of the order) and so is resident and
 * compaction-immune: it survives the context eviction that drops
 * a skill body mid-session, which is the eviction the gates exist
 * to backstop. The gates still enforce regardless of cwd; this is
 * the always-on baseline that reduces how often they have to
 * fire, not the enforcement itself.
 *
 * The block is injected only inside a git work tree, where PR,
 * commit, issue and Slack authoring actually happens, so an
 * unrelated cwd does not pay the token cost.
