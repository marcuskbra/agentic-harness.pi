/**
 * Answering the working layer when it asks who holds a tree.
 *
 * A quest cuts worktrees and records them on its frontmatter, which
 * the working layer's broker knows nothing about. From git's side the
 * two are identical: a directory, a branch, and no record in the
 * broker's memory. So the working layer's reclamation would happily
 * take back a tree a live quest is holding, and the first run of it
 * against a real repository did exactly that.
 *
 * The fix belongs here rather than there. The working layer must not
 * learn what a quest is, and asking over the bus means any other
 * package that cuts trees can answer the same question without either
 * side importing the other.
