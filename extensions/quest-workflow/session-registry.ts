/**
 * Real-dependency wiring for the session registry.
 *
 * The pure store in `lib/internal/quest/session-registry` shapes
 * records and answers questions about them. This module supplies the
 * live pieces: where the records live, reading and writing them, the
 * heartbeat that dates a death nothing else can date, and the repair
 * a reader performs when it finds a session's process gone.
 *
 * Every record is written by exactly one live process, its own, so
 * there is no lock here and no read-modify-write race to protect
 * against. The one exception is the repair below, which writes to a
 * record whose owner is by definition no longer running.
