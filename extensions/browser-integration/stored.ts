/**
 * The browser family's half of the store-and-cite bargain.
 *
 * A page read used to hand back however much outline the page
 * happened to render. On an ordinary application that is a few
 * kilobytes; on one source file of eighteen thousand lines it was
 * two and a half megabytes, and a wheel scroll returned all of it
 * because every action answers with the page it left behind.
 *
 * Now the view is bounded and the tree is kept. What the caller
 * reads is as much outline as the budget affords; what they can
 * still reach is every node, by query. The two are the same
 * capture, so narrowing never means reading a page that has since
 * moved.
