/**
 * How the four browser tools read in the transcript.
 *
 * A tool call is a line somebody skims while waiting, so each
 * one says the verb, the thing it acted on, and nothing else.
 * "browser see element navigation Main" is legible at a glance;
 * a serialized parameter object is not, and it is the same
 * information.
 *
 * Results are summarised to their first meaningful line, with
 * the verdict mark kept when there is one. A check that says
 * FAIL should still say FAIL when it is collapsed, since that is
 * the whole reason somebody scrolls back.
 *
 * Every Text here is built with padding (0, 0). Text defaults to
 * one column and one row of padding, and pi already wraps a tool
 * row in a Box that pads it, so accepting the default pads the
 * same content twice: a blank line above and below every call
 * and every result, which turns a transcript of short lines into
 * mostly empty screen. This is the one rule in pi's own
 * rendering best practices that costs nothing to follow and is
 * invisible until somebody screenshots the terminal.
