/**
 * Bounding a Slack answer without losing what it was rendered

 * Slack is the family where this matters most after the browser. A
 * DM history asked for with no limit is every message in the
 * window, and this extension's own guidance tells the model to do
 * exactly that rather than draw conclusions from a partial read.
 * That advice was right and expensive. Now it is only right: the
 * view is bounded, and every message stays queryable.
 *
 * The rule and the heuristic are shared; what belongs to Slack is
 * knowing how a caller asks for less.
