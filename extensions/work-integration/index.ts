/**
 * Work Integration Extension
 *
 * Hosts the working layer: owns the tree provider registry for a
 * session, registers the plain-git provider this package ships,
 * and exposes the `work` tool.
 *
 * Providers register over the event bus rather than by importing
 * the registry, so a specialised one can live in another package
 * entirely. World's `dev tree` is the motivating case: it knows
 * how to cut a tree from a monorepo nobody wants a plain worktree
 * of, and it has no business being in this package. The handshake
 * runs both ways, as the review substrate's does, so neither
 * load order matters.
