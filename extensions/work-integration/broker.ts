 * The roster is passed as a function rather than an array, which
 * matters more than it looks. Providers register over the bus and
 * load order between extensions is nobody's choice, so a broker
 * that snapshotted its roster would never consult a provider that
 * registered later. That bug shipped once already, in the broker's
