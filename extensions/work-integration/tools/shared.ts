/**
 * Answer helpers for the work tools.
 *
 * These are close cousins of `extensions/review-integration/
 * tools/shared.ts`, and that is deliberate rather than
 * overlooked. Two consumers of a four-line helper is a
 * coincidence; three is a pattern worth a home in `lib/ui`. When a
 * third surface wants `say` and `refuse`, move all three then,
 * rather than promoting a shared module on the strength of one
 * duplicate and having to guess at what it should cover.
 *
 * What must not drift is the refusal contract: a refusal carries
 * an `error` in its details, which is what `isRefusal` and the
 * renderer both read. A refusal a caller cannot detect without
 * parsing prose is the failure mode to avoid here.
