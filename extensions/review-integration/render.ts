/**
 * How the substrate talks to a person.
 *
 * Three rules hold this together. The first is that a glyph is a
 * noun: one per concept, always the same one, never two in a
 * row, so the eye learns the vocabulary instead of decoding a
 * new rebus each time. The second is that degradation is
 * narrated as a sentence rather than tabulated as a diagnostic,
 * because "three remarks will land on lines, one becomes prose
 * because its anchor moved" is something a person can act on.
 *
 * The third is that the interface is drawn in geometry, not
 * emoji. That is the house style, and it is a legibility
 * argument rather than a taste one: a geometric glyph is one
 * column wide in every terminal, renders the same on every
 * machine, and stays distinguishable in monochrome, none of
 * which is true of emoji. Shape carries the meaning, so the
 * vocabulary works without colour at all.
 *
 * Shapes are grouped by what kind of thing they name. Diamonds
 * are the review and its parts, circles are what will happen to
 * them, and the rest are containers and marks.
 *
 * Artifacts are a different surface and play by different
 * rules: a pull request body, an issue body and a quest README
 * all carry emoji section markers by convention, and none of
 * this applies to them. Nor does any of it reach a forge. What
 * gets posted is someone else's surface, and decorating it
 * would be rude.
