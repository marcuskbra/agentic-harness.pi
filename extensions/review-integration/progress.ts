/**
 * A round, while it runs, as something you can watch and stop.
 *
 * The first version of this drew one status line and called that enough,
 * on the reasoning that the defect was silence and one line ends silence.
 * That was wrong twice over. Silence was only the first complaint: the
 * next two are not knowing *which* participant is still working, and not
 * being able to stop a round you have reconsidered. A status line answers
 * neither, because it has room for one participant's activity and no room
 * at all for a key binding.
 *
 * So this restores what the older surface had: a panel in the prompt area
 * listing every participant, its state and what it is doing, with the
 * status line kept beside it as the one-glance summary. Escape cancels.
 *
 * Cancellation is real here rather than cosmetic, which it could not be
 * before. Three separate comments in this extension claimed pi hands a
 * tool's execute no cancellation signal; the signature is
 * `execute(toolCallId, params, signal, onUpdate, ctx)` and it always had
 * one. The subagent runner already kills a child on abort, so the only
 * thing missing was passing the signal down.
