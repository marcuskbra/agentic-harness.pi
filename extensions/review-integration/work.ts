/**
 * Reaching the working layer, when something hosts one.
 *
 * A reviewer needs a tree to read. It should not be whatever
 * directory the session happens to sit in, because a change that is
 * not checked out there gets reviewed against unrelated code and the
 * answer looks perfectly plausible.
 *
 * What it wants is a **snapshot**: pinned to the commit under review,
 * never written to, and shareable, so six reviewers reading the same
 * commit share one tree rather than cutting six. That is exactly the
 * distinction `lib/work` draws between a snapshot and a worktree, and
 * the reason a snapshot's identity excludes nothing but its paths.
 *
 * The seam is the event bus, so this package needs the work library
 * and never the work extension. If nothing answers, asking still
 * succeeds and says it fell back, because a round is worth running
 * against a checkout of the right repo and is not worth losing to a
 * missing optional dependency.
 *
 * Falling back has one limit, and it is not about the commit. A
 * directory that is a checkout of some other project is not a worse
 * tree, it is a different subject, so a round with nowhere honest to
 * stand refuses instead of degrading.
