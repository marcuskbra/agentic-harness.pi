/**
 * Objecting to a publish that would eject a queued change.
 *
 * The working layer asks before it pushes, because the reason not to push is
 * often something only the hosting layer knows. This is that answer. On a
 * backend with a merge queue, pushing to a queued branch ejects it and
 * everything speculatively batched with it, and re-running the checks for the
 * rest is measured in hundreds of jobs. Nothing in `lib/work` knows what a queue
 * is, and it should not: the layer that knows why is the layer that explains it.
 *
 * The whole thing is best-effort by design. Resolving a branch to a change means
 * asking a backend, which can be slow, unauthenticated, or simply wrong about a
 * branch that has no change at all. None of those may stop a push. A person who
 * cannot publish because a review provider is having a bad day would rightly
 * disable this, and then it would protect nobody.
