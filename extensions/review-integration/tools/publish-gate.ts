/**
 * The gate that sends a review, and what it shows.
 *
 * It used to show `planNarration` and nothing else: op counts and raw
 * thread uuids, not one word of the text about to go on somebody else's
 * change. The gate that sends the most showed the least.
 *
 * Now every operation gets a tab and every tab shows its payload whole.
 * The Plan tab leads, carrying the narration, the degradations and the
 * refusals, so the summary is still the first thing read. Rejecting a tab
 * drops the draft items behind it and the plan is compiled again without
 * them, which makes the gate the last chance to drop a remark rather than
 * something you have to run `review_draft drop` for before you can see
 * what you would be dropping.
 *
 * Tabs come from operations rather than draft items on purpose. An
 * operation is what will actually be sent, and the review operation
 * carries several remarks in one request: splitting it into a tab per
 * remark would offer a rejection the backend cannot honour, and pairing
 * remarks back to items would be guesswork, since the compiler does not
 * record which comment came from which item. Each remark is a view
 * instead, so all of them can be read before the one request is approved.
