/**
 * `review_ask`: putting a change to other models.
 *
 * The rounds are separate kinds rather than one `run` with a mode,
 * because a council and a judge differ in what they are told, what
 * they are allowed to conclude, and how their findings are
 * attributed. Reading them back is `review_see findings`, and
 * deciding what to do about them is `review_draft decide`: this tool
 * only produces.
 *
 * Participants read a snapshot pinned to the commit under review,
 * cut through the working layer, so a change that is not checked out
 * here is still reviewed against its own code. When no working layer
 * is loaded, or the provider cannot say which commit is under review,
 * the round still runs against the caller's own tree and says so:
 * losing a council to a missing optional dependency would be worse
 * than a caveat, and reviewing the wrong code silently would be worse
 * than both.

/**
 * What a round's answer says, painted.
 *
 * The wording and the order are the library's, and this is only the
 * brush. They were both here once, where nothing could test them, and
 * that is where the two bugs the wiring alone showed were living.
 *
 * GLYPH.failed for a participant, not GLYPH.refused, and the same mark
 * the live panel draws against the same line. A participant whose run
 * broke did not refuse anything, and watching one fail with one mark
 * and then reading the identical fact under another invites the
 * question of whether two things happened to it.
