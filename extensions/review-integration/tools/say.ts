/**
 * The `review_say` tool: saying something, now.
 *
 * This is the flow an author lives in on their own change, and
 * it is deliberately ceremony-free: reply, resolve, react. The
 * ceremony belongs to `review_draft`, which composes a whole
 * review rather than answering one remark, and the overlap
 * between the two is kept on purpose: answering one comment and
 * composing a review that happens to answer it are different
 * acts, and forcing the first through a draft would be ceremony
 * for its own sake.
 *
 * Reading the conversation belongs to `review_see`. This tool
 * only writes, so every action here asks first.
 *
 * Registration only. What each action does, and what its gate shows,
 * lives in `batch.ts`, because the singular parameters are read as a
 * batch of one and both go down the same road.
