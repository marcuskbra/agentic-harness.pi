/**
 * The authoring conventions, checked where authoring actually happens.
 *
 * A guardian intercepts shell commands, so `gh pr create` is held to
 * the PR format, the title convention and the prose standard. Proposing
 * a change through `review_offer` never touches a shell: it builds a
 * JSON body and posts it to an API. Left alone, that is a way to route
 * around every convention this package enforces, and the better the
 * tool got the more attractive that route became.
 *
 * So the same three checks run here, over the same detectors, before
 * anything is sent. This is not the guardian's code copied: the
 * detectors are pure and shared, and only the response differs. A
 * guardian blocks a command and relents to a human on a repeat, because
 * it cannot rewrite the words. A tool can simply be called again with a
 * better body, so a refusal here is a plain refusal with no relent
 * path, which is also why it cannot loop.
 *
 * The same formatters too. This used to tally an issue word against the
 * offending text, which said "use Canadian English spelling" without
 * naming the word, and printed the title rule's internal word list as
 * though it were a diagnosis: `sentence-case: fix(review, replay,
 * whole, resolution`. The guardian's blocks already name the word and
 * its replacement, and explain what Title Case wants, so both paths now
 * say the same thing and there is one place to improve it.
