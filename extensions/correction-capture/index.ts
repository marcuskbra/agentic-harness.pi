/**
 * Correction Capture Extension
 *
 * Turns the steering you do in a session into durable behavioural
 * rules. When you ask the agent to remember a lesson, it calls
 * `capture_lesson`, which distills the corrections in the current
 * session into drafted rules using a cheap side model, shows them
 * back for you to edit by talking, and files the ones you approve
 * into the governance rule store.
 *
 * The store is user-global and human-editable. Its rules ride the
 * prompt coordinator as a resident block, so a lesson captured in
 * one session is standing guidance in the next, and they are the
 * watch-list the advisor reviews turns against. There is no
 * command; you drive it by talking.
