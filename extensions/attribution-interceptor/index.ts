/**
 * Attribution Interceptor Extension
 *
 * Injects AI co-authorship attribution into commits, PRs, and
 * issues created through Pi. Makes AI involvement transparent
 * for analytics tooling.
 *
 * Runs before guardians (alphabetical load order), so the user
 * sees the injected attribution during review. Returns undefined
 * to let subsequent handlers proceed with the modified command.
 *
 * Runs whether or not there is a UI. Attribution is a silent
 * command rewrite with no panel, like the other interceptors,
 * and transparency matters most in the headless and subagent
 * runs nobody is watching. The rewrite is idempotent, so a
 * command that already carries attribution is left alone.
 *
 * This extension mutates `event.input.command` directly rather
 * than going through `registerGuardian`, because interceptors
 * are a sanctioned mutation site for silent command enrichment
 * (see AGENTS.md "One Mutation Site for Command Rewriting").
 *
 * Attribution is unconditional: there is no opt-out flag. A gh
 * entity command in a shape we cannot parse well enough to
 * attribute is blocked, with a reason that asks the agent to
 * reissue it in a simpler form, rather than allowed to run
 * un-attributed.
