/**
 * How a query reads in the transcript.
 *
 * A query is two short facts: what was asked, and how much came
 * back. Both fit on one line, so the collapsed view is one line
 * and the expanded view adds the matches themselves.
 *
 * Text is built with (0, 0) throughout: pi already wraps every
 * tool row in a padded box, and taking the default pads it twice.
