/**
 * One query language over every tool's stored output.
 *
 * Tools in this package that can answer with a large payload keep
 * the whole payload on disk and hand back a bounded view plus a
 * handle. This extension is the other half of that bargain: the
 * tool that turns a handle back into an answer, and the session
 * lifetime that decides how long a handle is worth citing.
 *
 * It is one tool rather than one per family because the cost of a
 * query language is learning it, and that cost is only paid once
 * if the language does not change depending on who stored the
 * payload. A browser page outline, a Slack thread and a
 * language-server reference list are all queried the same way.
